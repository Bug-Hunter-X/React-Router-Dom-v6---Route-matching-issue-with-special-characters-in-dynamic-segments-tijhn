In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a dynamic segment that includes a special character (e.g., '+', '?', '/', etc.) can cause unexpected behavior or prevent the navigation from working correctly.  This often manifests as the route not rendering the expected component or throwing a routing error. The issue arises due to how React Router Dom interprets these characters within the URL path.  For example, if you have a route like `/users/+123` and attempt to navigate to it, it might not match the route correctly.
